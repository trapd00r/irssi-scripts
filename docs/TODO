* Documentation
** Finish writing up function defs in Irssi:: namespace
** Write up more stuff on Themes, including brief tutorial
** Fill in more stuff in Guide
** Write up what triggers signals, when/how, etc.
** Rest of docs
*** Window
*** WindowItem
*** Server
*** Channel
*** Query
*** Theme/View/Accessing screen content
* Doc Gen
** Prettify snippets with perltidy HTML mode
** Javascript(?) c&p generator for signals
   eg:
   sub handle_sig_<foo> {
       my ($arg1, $arg2, $arg3) = @_;
   }
   Irssi::signal_add("<foo>", \&handle_sig_<foo>);

** Make CSS suck less (steal from perldoc.perl.org?)
** Sidebar/frameset with quick links menu? 

** Write parser for module-formats files and incorporate into docs somewhere
*** Some sort of javascript bacon for viewing default formats?
    Or just a big list?

** Have something to check link validity, since refs have changed a lot
** Index page
*** Make it more multi-level, split on namespaces

* Misc Code
** finish off build-signals script to parse POD and produce signals header file.

* Patches
** Bindings
*** Figure out how memory management / ref-counting works, and check for leaks
*** Add "binding added/changed/deleted" signals
*** Talk to someone (Bazerka?) about merging into trunk
*** Proof of concept (modify adv_windowlist to use bindings rather than parsing cmd)

** Abstract raw access
*** Where are they stored - why doesn't get_format work?
** Statusbars
*** Access to entries (as objects)
*** Create
*** Remove
** StatusbarItems
*** List (given sbar)
*** Enable/Disable
** Aliases
*** Add / Modify
*** Remove
*** List
*** Fetch Single
*** Signals

* Misc Stuff
** Publicise it a bit more, try to get links from people
** Host on metavore?
** Talk to maintainers about inclusion in core
*** Maybe as patches to .xs files + parsing scripts?
